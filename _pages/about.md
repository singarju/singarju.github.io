## About Me

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington and a software engineer with 2+ years of professional experience building scalable, efficient, and secure software systems. My expertise spans full-stack development, cloud computing with AWS, and Machine Learning/NLP applications.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about:
- **Full-Stack Development**: TypeScript, React, Python, Node.js, and modern web frameworks
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS (Lambda, S3, SQS, DynamoDB), serverless architectures, and infrastructure automation
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Large Language Models (LLMs), NLP techniques, MLOps, and generative AI applications
- **System Design**: Architecting scalable solutions with focus on performance optimization and cost efficiency
- **Software Engineering Excellence**: CI/CD pipelines, containerization, testing, and best practices

## Professional Highlights

- Reduced emergency response time from 60 to 5 seconds by engineering an in-house SOS button application in C++
- Increased library adoption by 20+ companies through database-agnostic architecture design
- Optimized communication time by 85% through performance improvements in vehicle systems
- Engineered serverless NLP chatbots for AWS cost optimization analysis
- Built scalable e-commerce applications supporting 1,000+ concurrent users

## Technical Stack

**Languages & Frameworks**: Python, C, C++, TypeScript, React, PostgreSQL, MySQL, HTML5/CSS3  
**Cloud & DevOps**: AWS, Docker, Terraform, Datadog, CI/CD pipelines  
**AI/ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain, LLMs, NLP  
**Tools & Practices**: SDLC, Agile, Scrum, TDD, System Design
